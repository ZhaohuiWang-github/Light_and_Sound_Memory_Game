Submitted by: **Zhaohui Wang**

Time spent: **4.5** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [x] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Video Walkthrough (GIF)

If you recorded multiple GIFs for all the implemented features, you can add them here:  

The gifs below show the optional features I implemented:  
* There are five buttons, and each button has its own background image which would show up as you click it. To make the game harder as it goes on, the clue playback would speed up on each turn.

* The pattern is randomly generated at the beginning of the game.

* Players are allowed to make up to 2 mistakes before they lose the game. The game fails when the player makes the third mistake.

* Thereâ€™s a countdown clock at the bottom, and players have 30 seconds for each round.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]

When I was writing the second optional function, at first, I just followed the tips in the tutorial and updated the clueHoldTime in playClueSequence. However, I was used to testing code robustness in extreme cases. During testing, I found that if users click stop and then click Start, the playback speed would be very fast, and sometimes I could not even hear the sound playing. To locate and fix the problem, I used console.log to output the clueHoldTime for each round. Then I found that when a new round of the game started, the clueHoldTime would not change back to the initial 1000ms, but would continue to decrease from the previously updated one. Therefore, I reinitialized the clueHoldTime in startGame and solved the problem.   

This taught me three lessons. First, keep thinking instead of just follow the steps in the tutorial. Second, get into the habit of testing the feasibility of the code under special input and special interaction conditions, which can make the code more robust. Third, be good at using the console to monitor the intermediate results of the code, so that you can find and fix bugs faster.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]

I know that in actual web development work, engineers use web frameworks to help them become more efficient and help other developers understand their code. What are the most commonly used web frameworks in practical work? How do engineers choose the right web framework when web development? What are the latest web frameworks worth learning?   

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]  

After I submitted my application, I only had 2 days left to finish the pre-work, so there were some features I wanted to implement that I didn't have time to implement. 

If I had more time, I would add a difficulty level option to this game so that players can customize the difficulty level of the game. The difficulty level can be changed in two ways.   

One is to change the number of buttons to memorize. Instead of the fixed 8 buttons, players are able to choose the number of buttons to memorize. The other is to change the limit time of the game. I currently set the game time to 30s. I hope that players can adjust the limit time by themselves in the future.   

With these difficulty level settings, this game will be suitable for more players of different ages to play and will make users feel more challenging and accomplished.
